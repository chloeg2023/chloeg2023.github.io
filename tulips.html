<div> This is going to be an <b>arrangement</b> of tulips. 
	
<ul>
	<li>White Tulips</li>
	<li>Pink Tulips</li>
	
</ul>
<p>
Tulips are vibrant flowers that can in a variety of flowers. They are very easy to grow at home and are typically seen in large fields. They can stay alive for about 1-2 weeks in a vase, and sometimes 3. I highly recommend these flowers for a centerpiece or on a desk!
